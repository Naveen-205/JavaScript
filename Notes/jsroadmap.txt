JavaScript Interview Roadmap

This roadmap is structured to take you from the fundamental building blocks of the language to the more complex, real-world applications.

#### Level 1: JavaScript Fundamentals (The Core Language)

This is the absolute foundation. You must know this section perfectly.

1.  *Variables & Scope*
    *   Declaration (var name;), Initialization (name = "John";), and Assignment.
    *   **var, let, and const*: This is a critical interview question. Understand their differences in terms of **scope* (Global, Function, Block), *hoisting, **re-declaration, and **re-assignment*.
    *   *Hoisting*: Understand how JavaScript handles declarations for variables (var, let, const) and functions before execution.
    *   *Scope & Lexical Scoping*: Understand what scope is, how it works, and how nested functions have access to variables in their parent scopes (Lexical Environment).

2.  *Data Types*
    *   *Primitive Types*: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt. Know the difference between null and undefined.
    *   *Non-Primitive (Reference) Types*: Object, Array, Function. Understand that these are stored as references, not values.

3.  *Operators*
    *   *Arithmetic*: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
    *   *Assignment*: =, +=, -=
    *   *Comparison*: == vs. === (very important!), != vs. !==, >, <, >=, <=
    *   *Logical*: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
    *   *Ternary Operator*: condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

4.  *Control Flow*
    *   *Conditionals*: if, else if, else, switch
    *   *Loops*: for, while, do...while, and the iterators for...in (for objects) and for...of (for arrays/iterables).

#### Level 2: Data Structures & Functions

These are the tools you'll use every day to manage data and logic.

1.  *Functions*
    *   *Function Declaration*: function myFunction() {}
    *   *Function Expression*: const myFunction = function() {};
    *   *Arrow Functions (ES6)*: const myFunction = () => {};. Understand how this behaves differently in arrow functions.
    *   Parameters and Arguments.

2.  *Objects*
    *   Creating objects (literal syntax, constructor).
    *   Accessing properties (dot notation vs. bracket notation).
    *   Adding, modifying, and deleting properties.
    *   *Object Methods*: Understanding Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries().

3.  *Arrays*
    *   Creating arrays and accessing elements by index.
    *   Basic methods: push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), slice(), splice().
    *   *Higher-Order Array Methods (Must Know!)*:
        *   forEach(): To loop over elements.
        *   map(): To create a new array by transforming each element.
        *   filter(): To create a new array with elements that pass a test.
        *   reduce(): To execute a reducer function and get a single output value.
        *   find(): To get the first element that passes a test.
        *   some() / every(): To check if some or all elements pass a test.

#### Level 3: Modern JavaScript (ES6+ Features)

These features make JavaScript more powerful and easier to write.

1.  *Destructuring*
    *   *Object Destructuring*: const { name, age } = user;
    *   *Array Destructuring*: const [first, second] = myArray;

2.  **Spread and Rest Operators (...)**
    *   *Spread Operator*: Used to expand iterables (e.g., merging arrays [...arr1, ...arr2], copying objects {...obj}).
    *   *Rest Operator*: Used to collect the "rest" of the elements into an array (e.g., in function parameters function(...args)).

3.  *Template Literals*
    *   Using back-ticks (`` ` ``) for multi-line strings and embedded expressions: `` Hello, ${name}! ``.

#### Level 4: How JavaScript Really Works (The "Tricky" Concepts)

These topics separate junior developers from mid-level developers.

1.  **The this Keyword (Crucial Topic)**
    *   Understand how the value of this is determined in different contexts: Global context, as an object method, in a simple function, in an event listener, and in an arrow function.

2.  *Closures*
    *   A function that remembers its outer lexical environment, even after the outer function has returned. This is a very common and important interview question.

3.  *Callbacks*
    *   A function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function. This is the foundation for asynchronous programming.

#### Level 5: Asynchronous JavaScript

Modern web development is almost entirely asynchronous.

1.  *Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code*
    *   Understand the difference and why async is necessary.

2.  *The Event Loop (Important Concept You Missed)*
    *   Have a basic understanding of the Call Stack, Callback Queue (or Task Queue), and how the Event Loop allows JavaScript to be non-blocking.

3.  *Promises*
    *   The modern way to handle async operations. Understand the states: pending, fulfilled, rejected.
    *   Methods: .then() for success, .catch() for errors, and .finally() for cleanup.
    *   Promise methods: Promise.all(), Promise.race().

4.  **async/await**
    *   Syntactic sugar on top of Promises that makes async code look and feel synchronous.
    *   Using async to declare a function and await to pause execution until a Promise settles.
    *   Error handling with try...catch.

5.  **APIs & fetch**
    *   Understanding what a web API is.
    *   Using the fetch() API to make network requests (e.g., GET, POST) to a server. This is a practical application of Promises.

#### Level 6: JavaScript in the Browser (The DOM)

This is how you make web pages interactive.

1.  *The DOM (Document Object Model)*
    *   What it is and how it represents an HTML document as a tree of objects.

2.  *Selecting & Manipulating Elements*
    *   *Selecting*: document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), document.querySelectorAll().
    *   *Manipulating*: Changing properties like .innerHTML, .textContent, .style, and attributes like .setAttribute().
    *   Creating and removing elements: document.createElement(), .appendChild(), .removeChild().

3.  *Events*
    *   Handling user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.
    *   *Event Listeners*: Using element.addEventListener('click', function) to run code when an event happens.
    *   The event object.

4.  *Form Handling*
    *   A practical use case for DOM manipulation and events.
    *   Getting values from input fields.
    *   Handling the submit event and using event.preventDefault().

#### Level 7: Browser Storage

How to save data on the user's computer.

1.  **localStorage**: Persistent storage that stays even after the browser is closed.
2.  **sessionStorage**: Storage that is cleared when the browser tab is closed.
3.  *Cookies*: Small strings of data sent between the browser and server. Understand the basic use case (e.g., session management).
